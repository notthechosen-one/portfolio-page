    <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;Puerto Galera</h1>
    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A town in in the island of Oriental Mindoro</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tourist hotspot perfect for doing activities like diving, swimming, kayaking, paddleboarding in the water. For land activities &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;tourist can hike, visit the villages of the Mangyan or eat foods that are popular in the town.&nbsp;This town has many more to offer,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;you can visit the town by riding the ferry from Batangas City.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the many islands in the Philippines that is a must to go to. In the Pre-Colonial Era, Puerto Galera is a place<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;where all of the indigenous Mangyan people lived. When the Spanish arrived it became the safe harbour for trading to Manila <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;and other parts of Asia. As they continue to be occupied by Americans and Japanese, they finally gained independence and <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;making the island a place for tourists to visit and checkout traditional food and what they do.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my favorite place because it has many beaches and swimming pools which is my favorite because I enjoy swimming.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The town also has cuisines that is not very common to me, exploring different food choices, whether it is based on tradition or <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;modern innovation, it was truly a delightful adventure. Every meal was an opportunity to experience new flavors and the culinary expertise of the area, from<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;savory seafood meals grilled fresh by the seaside to unusual local specialties I had never heard of before. It added another<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;level of cultural immersion to my trip and really enhanced my time in Puerto Galera.
